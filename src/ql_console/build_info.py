"""Resolve the git commit the running build was made from.

Two sources, in order:
  * ``_commit.py`` — written at build time by ``tools/build_exe.py`` and
    bundled into the frozen exe (where git isn't available).
  * ``git rev-parse`` in the source checkout during development.

Returns ``""`` when neither is available, so callers can hide it.
